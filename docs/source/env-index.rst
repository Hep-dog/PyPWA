The purpose of this documentation is to help new developers get up to speed
quickly with contributing to PyPWA. This should be able to take your favorite
Linux box and set it up with a Python Development Environment and PyPWA
ready to be worked on.

The three different ways to install a development environment on your machine:
   A. The Virtualenv instructions uses your systems packages to create a
      virtual environment that supports both BASH and CSH.
   B. The Anaconda instructions will have you installing Anaconda or
      Miniconda onto your system, then using the Conda environment for your
      development.
   C. Lastly, the JLab instructions walk you through how to set up your system
      on a JLab Machine, this method blends both the Anaconda and
      Virtualenv methods.
