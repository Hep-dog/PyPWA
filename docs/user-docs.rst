User Documentation
==================
Welcome to `PyPWA's`_ user documentation. By following these documents you
should be able to learn enough of the package to be able to install and start
using PyPWA on your local machine and on the farm.

If you have any issues with the documentation or with PyPWA, please let us 
know on our `issue`_ tracker.

.. note::
   Make sure that you are using a version of documentation that corresponds
   to the installed version of PyPWA before reporting issues, as the
   documentation is constantly updated to reflect the state of PyPWA at that
   time. If you are reading this on readthedocs.org then the version should
   be in the bottom left corner.
