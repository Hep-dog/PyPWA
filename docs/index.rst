Welcome to PyPWA's documentation!
=================================
`PyPWA`_ is a python based software framework designed to perform Partial
Wave and Amplitude Analysis with the goal of extracting resonance information
from multiparticle final states.

If you have any issues with the documentation or with PyPWA, please let us know
on our `issue`_ tracker.


.. note::
   Make sure that you are using a version of the documentation that corresponds
   to your installed version of `PyPWA`_ before reporting issues, as the 
   documentation is constantly updated to reflect the state of PyPWA at that time.
