When the dashboard opens for the first time
the display will read that there isn't a saved 
list and that all the data will have to be 
updated to plot.

Hit pwa Controls and make sure that all the 
information there is correct. The last two 
are the only ones that will affect plotting.

1st: Hit Update All and wait for the display
    to read "PlotList updated."

2nd: Hit save and wait for the dashboard to 
    update with the individual wave buttons.

3rd: Hit any and all buttons for what you 
    would like to plot and then hit plot.

You will have to close the plot window to 
plot again.

After the first run, the data will be 
automaticaly loaded, which will be indicated
by the display. Start with step 3.
