This module loads data from various data types to be used
inside the program as they would like. Data types supported
are the classic Kinematic Variable files defined by Josh
Pond, the QFactors List, the Weight list, the Condensed
single line Weight, and the Tab or Comma separated
kinematic variables.

Examples:
    To load data from file:
        file = PyPWA.data.file_manager.MemoryInterface()
        file.parse(path_to_file)
    To write data to file:
        file = PyPWA.data.file_manager.MemoryInterface()
        file.write(path_to_file, the_data)
