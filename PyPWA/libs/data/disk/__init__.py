Objects for reading data from disk

All modules in this package are designed and optimized to read specific data
from the disk including GAMP events. This data reading method will be slower
than traditional memory based methods but should be more resource efficient.
Best used for data that is too large for your memory and can not be used in
place of memory based functions.
