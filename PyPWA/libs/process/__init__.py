"""
This is the builtin plugin for Multiprocessing, it works by taking the
users kernels and interface and nesting them into their own individual
processes and the interface that is connected to them, then returns that
interface so that the user can manipulate those processes.

Example:
    foreman = CalculationForeman()
    foreman.populate(AbstractInterface, AbstractKernels)
    interface = foreman.fetch_interface()
    processed_value = interface.run("Your args")
