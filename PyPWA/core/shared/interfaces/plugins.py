"""
The core definition of plugins and how they work.
-------------------------------------------------
All the different plugin types are defined here, these interfaces should be
extended when writing your own plugins so that your own plugin can replace
the internal plugins without any issues.

.. note::
   Some of these interfaces have a main method called "main_options",
   this method exists so that options not passed via the __init__ can be
   loaded into the object still before running. Typically this is for
   runtime variables and not for user variables.

- Optimizer - This is the interface for minimizer and maximizer alike.

- KernelProcessing - This defines how kernel processing works, simply,
  the kernel processing works by taking a kernel of code, a package of
  data, then using those to calculate more data. The interface to interact
  with the resulting processes, threads, etc, and the core kernel that you
  should expect to return are all in internals.py

- DataParser - This is a parser that will return a numpy array,
  or something that operates a lot like a numpy array. It is expected that
  all events will be returned at once, or a reference to all events. Should
  also be able to write data as well.

- DataIterator - This is more complex parser, this parser should be able to
  read and write a single event at a time, as such should be able to be used
  in iteration, or as a file handle.

- Main - This is a simple interface for the main objects.
