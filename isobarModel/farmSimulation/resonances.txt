# resonances.txt is the control file that devTest uses to get resonances to simulate from waves.
# Add resonaces starting on line 6 in the format cR (float) wR (list) w0 (float) r0 (float) phase (float)
# Ex: 1.0 1.0,0.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 
# One resonance to a line and use the # to comment.
# 
1.0 1.0,0.0,0.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 
1.0 1.0,0.0,0.5 1.0 0.5 0.0  
1.0 1.0,0.0,0.5 1.0 0.5 0.0
