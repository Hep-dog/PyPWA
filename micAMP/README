MIC Amplitude Offload
=====================
This is the MIC offload library originally written by Mathew Vick and is
currently being maintained by Will Phelps.

To compile:
1. Make a directory named build.
2. Change into the build directory
3. Run "cmake path_to/micAmp"
4. Run make
5. ???
6. Profit!!

Issues
------
Currently there are issues related to cmake. Cmake doesn't compile
correctly, the incorrect compile arguments are sent to the compiler. This
isn't a fault of the program, just the fact that I (Mark Jones) doesn't
know the correct arguments. Change the CMakeLists.txt file to have the
arguements.
